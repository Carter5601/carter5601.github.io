    <h1>Merry Christmas Dad!</h1>

    <p>I have been practicing my web development lately and wanted to share
    the love. So, here it goes. Merry Christmas!! This is your Christmas gift!
    It's a website.</p>

    <h2>Thanks are in order</h2>

    <p>You have taught me so much. I learned what it meant to speak my mind and
      my testimony with power from you. I learned how to love and serve and
      give from you. I learned to pay an honest tithe and a generous fast
      offering and to be a righteous priesthood holder from you. From you I
      learned to look to my Savior. Thanks dad, for all these <em>From you's
      </em>.</p>

    <h2>A Favorite Scripture</h2>

    <p><a href='https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng'
      target='_blank'> Wherefore </a>, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea,
      even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men,
      which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God.</p>
